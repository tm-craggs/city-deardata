# #CreativeCoding2024

This is my final submission for the **#CreativeCoding2024** activity at City, University of London.

### The Activity 💡:

This acticvity involved:

📊 Data collection, design experiments and reflection

💬 Engagement and discussion with fellow students and academic mentors

🖌️ Considering the world through a lens in which data is a creative starting point for play and expression

🔗 Exploring the relationships between the world, data, code and themselves

⏳ Over a 12 week period. 

### Project Brief 📌

This task was the final submission for #CreativeCoding. It involved personally collecting data about daily habits or observations, inspired by the **Dear Data** project by _Giorgia Lupi_ and _Stefanie Posavec_

The original data we collected must be visualised in an expressive and creative way, and coded into a Processing Sketchbook using Java.

### My Submission 🧑‍💻

My sketch visualises my movements over the course of a week.

Each journey away from home is plotted to scale, with each pixel representing 100 metres, creating an accurate spatial representation of distance.
The sketch features a moving dot that dynamically traces my path as the user interacts with the program, bringing the data to life through animation.
